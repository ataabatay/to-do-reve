# Reve - sleak to do app

## Description
Reve is a solo 1day side project to work on creating a front-end only single page React (Vite) app. The idea was to practice general concepts of state, effect, props, validation, localstorage and design. 
<br/>
We all hate convoluted to do apps, the idea is to create a super simplistic/minimalistic to do app in React.

## Technologies Used
React for frontend with Tailwind for design

## Planning
### MVP (Done)
- An area to visualise all the active To Dos
- An ability:
  - to add a To Do
  - to complete a To Do
  - to delete a To Do
  - to edit a To Do
- Validation for when there’s no input value
- Turn the complete check into plus icon for the ability to move to do item back to ‘active’
- Localstorage
- Progress display

### V1 (Development stopped and will continue from here at a later date)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Drag to dos around the page to order
- Search to see if you can create a sub bullet by dragging a bullet inside another
- Search functionality:
  - ability to search for a todo
  - only displaying sought to dos
- A sidebar with a modal to view more on a specific To Do
- Ability to add sub-to-dos in the “view more” sidebar

### V2
- Backend
- Login and Register
- Creation of a user model
- Abiltiy to create/edit/delete multiple to do lists
- Ability to navigate to different to do lists

### V3
- Create different design systems
- Ability for users to select design they want
- Multiplayer functionality with websockets

## Wins 
- Managed to create a super sleak to do app with the main functionality in place
- Came to a real good grasp of useState and useEffect hooks

## Challenges and improvements
- Component-designwise I believe the app could have potentially been better structured
- There's a clear room to use context (Redux, etc.) but I didn't know at the time of completing this project
- Other versions haven't been attempted just yet.
